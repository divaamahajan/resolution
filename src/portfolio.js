This conflict, evident during critical moments like the client call incident, led to miscommunication and undermined team cohesion. The divergence between these competencies‚ÄîSarah's collaborative approach versus Debby's unilateral, rule-bound style‚Äîresulted in confusion and affected Sarah's confidence. Inadequate communication and unclear role expectations aggravated the situation. Addressing this required a shift in communication strategies and fostering a collaborative environment that blends the strengths of both competency sets. Recognizing and leveraging diverse competencies is crucial for a cohesive and innovative workplace culture that maximizes each team member's potential. The conflict resolution approaches displayed by Sarah showcased the influence of these gender competencies, emphasizing the need to appreciate and integrate diverse competencies for a more harmonious and productive work environment. Integrating these competencies lays the foundation for an inclusive organizational culture that thrives on diversity."
