Individualistic competencies encapsulate diverse approaches to work and conflict resolution. 'Transactors' view work as transactional, exchanging rewards or punishment, adopting a competitive win/lose mindset. 'Logical Thinking/Mechanistic Systems' prioritize logic-based decision-making with narrow focus and data-driven thinking. 'Firefighters' act heroically, prioritize singular tasks, and view customer service as problematic. 'Universality for continuity' emphasizes rules, goal-driven results, and negotiations for power. These competencies showcase a range of traits from strict adherence to rules to self-reliance, directive decision-making, and compartmentalized teamwork, all aimed at achieving individual intelligence and developmental roles."
