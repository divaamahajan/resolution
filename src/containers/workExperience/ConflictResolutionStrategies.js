      <h2>Avoiding</h2>
      <p>
        This strategy involves disregarding conflict, often chosen when individuals seek to steer clear of engagement or when there's no immediate resolution. It can lead to unresolved issues and potential friction between parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Competing</h2>
      <p>
        An assertive and uncooperative method where winning becomes the priority. It tends to lead to an unsatisfactory resolution without room for collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2>Accommodating</h2>
      <p>
        Also known as smoothing, this involves conceding to resolve the immediate problem, though it might not address long-term solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaborating</h2>
      <p>
        Requires working together to find mutually agreeable solutions, fostering a win-win scenario. It involves both parties in problem-solving.
      </p>

      <h2>Compromising</h2>
      <p>
        A lose-lose strategy where both parties sacrifice some needs to reach an agreement swiftly. It's a temporary fix to avoid further conflict until a more permanent solution can be implemented.
